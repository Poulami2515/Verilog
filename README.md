# Verilog

Component Instantiation : Providing instance of lower level module in higher level code<br>
edge triggering : circuit is activated through transition portion of clock<br>
                  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  positive edge triggering : activation at rising edge<br>
                  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  negative edge triggering : activation at falling edge<br>
level triggering : circuit is activated via voltage level <br>
